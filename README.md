### Features

| Feature                                | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sass support                           | Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) into CSS with ease, bringing support for variables, mixins and more. (Add your assets to the `src` directory and run `npm run start` to build)                                                                                                      |
| Performance optimization               | Minify and concatenate JavaScript, CSS, HTML and images to help keep your pages lean. (Run `npm run start` to create an optimised version of your project to `/dist`)                                                                                                |
| Code Linting               | JavaScript code linting is done using [ESLint](http://eslint.org) - a pluggable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Web Starter Kit uses ESLint with [eslint-config-google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google), which tries to follow the Google JavaScript style guide.                                                                                                |
| Built-in HTTP Server                   | A built-in server for previewing your site locally while you develop and iterate                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Live Browser Reloading                 | Reload the browser in real-time anytime an edit is made without the need for an extension. (Run `npm run start` and edit your files)                                                                                                                           |
| Cross-device Synchronization           | Synchronize clicks, scrolls, forms and live-reload across multiple devices as you edit your project. Powered by [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io). (Run `npm run start` and open up the IP provided on other devices on your network)                       |
| PageSpeed Insights                     | Web performance metrics showing how well your site performs on mobile and desktop (Run `npm run pagespeed`)                                                                                                                                                    |

## Quickstart

[Download](https://github.com/tony-jones/jekyll-starter-kit/releases/latest) the kit or clone this repository and build on what is included in the `src` directory.

Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run JSK.
Once you have verified that your system can run JSK, check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started.

## Web Performance

Jekyll Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box. Our median Web Page Test [scores](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151201_VW_XYC/) for the default template have a [Speed Index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) of ~1100 (1000 is ideal) and a repeat-visit Speed Index of ~550 thanks to Service Worker precaching. 

## Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 9+

This is not to say that Jekyll Starter Kit cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.

## Troubleshooting

If you find yourself running into issues during installation or running the tools, please open an [issue](https://github.com/tony-jones/jekyll-starter-kit/issues). I would be happy to discuss how they can be solved.
